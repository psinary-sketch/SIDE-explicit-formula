THIS PROGRAMME'S WORK (act b569, ruling (R179)(6); W-ORD-GRH-WEIL, act four) -- NOT VENDORED.
SPIRAL_MAP section 7 rule 9 applies here in full: `theorem`, never `lemma`.

THE χ-ANALOGUE OF THE ζ-INSTANCE OF Zeta23/WeilEF/Landau.lean (`zeta_logDeriv_partial_fraction`, :528): Landau's
partial fraction for `L'/L(s, χ)` near height `t`, from Zeta23's GENERIC `logDeriv_partial_fraction_disk` (any function
analytic on a closed disc, nonzero at its centre, with a growth bound), with the growth and the bounds of
Chi/ZetaGrowth.lean. The proof is Zeta23's, carried with `riemannZeta` replaced by `LFunction χ`; `LFunction χ` is entire
for `χ ≠ 1`, so Zeta23's check that the disc avoids the pole at `1` is dropped. Generated from the vendored file by relay
data/b569_gen_landau.py.txt (the replacements printed there). Nothing here proves GRH or locates any zero.

/-- **Partial fraction for L'/L at height t** (|t| ≥ 6), the χ-analogue of `zeta_logDeriv_partial_fraction`: there is a
finite set Z — exactly the zeros of `LFunction χ` within distance (22/25)·(91/50) of 2+it — such that on the ball of radius 3/2 around
2+it (covering 1/2 ≤ Re s ≤ 2 at height t), away from zeros,
L'/L(s) = Σ_{ρ ∈ Z} m_ρ/(s−ρ) + O(log(|t|+3)). -/
