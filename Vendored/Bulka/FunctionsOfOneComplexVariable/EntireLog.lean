## Entire logarithms for zero-free entire functions

This file provides a basic construction: if `f : ℂ → ℂ` is complex-differentiable everywhere and
never vanishes, then there exists a complex-differentiable function `g` with `f = exp ∘ g`.

We use:
- `Complex.isCoveringMap_exp` to lift `f` (viewed as a map into `ℂˣ`) through `exp`;
- a local inverse of `exp` (inverse function theorem) to upgrade the lift from continuous to
  complex-differentiable.
