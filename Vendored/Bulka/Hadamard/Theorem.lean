`Basic.lean` proves that a zero‑free entire function of finite order is an exponential of a
polynomial; here we package the order‑≤1 case as an exponential of a linear function.

/-- **Exponential constraint from symmetry**

If f satisfies f(z) = f(c - z) for some c, and f = exp(az + b) * P(z) where P
is a symmetric product (P(z) = P(c - z)), then exp(a * c) = 1.

This means a * c ∈ 2πiℤ. For real a and real c (as in the ξ function with c = 1),
this forces a * c = 0 since the only real element of 2πiℤ is 0.

For ξ, we have ξ(s) = ξ(1-s) with c = 1. If a is real, then a = 0.

Reference: This is a consequence of comparing f(z) = f(c-z) with the factored form.

  -- From f(z) = f(c-z) and the factored forms:
  --   exp(az + b) * P(z) = exp(a(c-z) + b) * P(c-z)
  -- Using P(z) = P(c-z):
  --   exp(az + b) = exp(a(c-z) + b)
  --   exp(az) = exp(ac - az)
  --   exp(2az - ac) = 1  for all z
  -- This requires 2az - ac = 2πik for all z, which forces a = 0 (coefficient of z must be 0)
  -- Hence a * c = 0.
  -- The key insight: from h_symm and h_factored with h_P_symm, for any z where P(z) ≠ 0:
  --   exp(az + b) * P(z) = exp(a(c-z) + b) * P(c-z) = exp(a(c-z) + b) * P(z)
  -- So exp(az) = exp(a(c-z)), i.e., exp(2az - ac) = 1
  -- Taking z = 0 and z = 1 (if both have P nonzero):
  --   exp(-ac) = 1  and  exp(2a - ac) = 1
  -- From these: exp(2a) = 1
  -- Combined with exp(-ac) = 1: exp(ac) = 1, exp(2a) = 1
  -- If a ≠ 0, then ac = 2πik and 2a = 2πim for some integers k, m
  -- So c = πik/a = πik / (πim) = k/m (rational multiple)
  -- But this doesn't force ac = 0 directly.
  --
  -- Better approach: use that h_symm holds for ALL z, including where P might be zero.
  -- Actually, if a ≠ 0 and c ≠ 0, pick z₁, z₂ with z₁ ≠ z₂ and P(z₁) ≠ 0, P(z₂) ≠ 0.
  -- Then exp(2a*z₁ - ac) = 1 and exp(2a*z₂ - ac) = 1
  -- So exp(2a*(z₁ - z₂)) = 1
  -- For this to hold for all pairs z₁, z₂ with P nonzero, we need 2a = 0, i.e., a = 0.

Corollary: If additionally a and c are real, then exp(ac) = 1 implies ac = 0.
The only real number w with exp(w) = 1 is w = 0.
