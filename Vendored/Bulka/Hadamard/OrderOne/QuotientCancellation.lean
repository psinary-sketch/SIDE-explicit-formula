Local quotient cancellation at a zero, counting multiplicity.

If `f` and `g` are analytic at `a` and have the same (finite) vanishing order at `a`, then the
quotient `f/g` has a removable singularity at `a`. We package this by constructing an explicit
piecewise definition that is analytic at `a`.

This is the pointwise ingredient needed to upgrade the “simple zeros” quotient arguments to the
general multiplicity regime.
